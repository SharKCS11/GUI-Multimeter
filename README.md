# GUI Multimeter
This is a small project to construct a combined voltmeter and ammeter that will output results to a GUI. The GUI will be first built in Matlab and possibly C++. Diagrams may show any board, but all circuits and code files are being built around a Funduino Mega-2650.

Updates will be posted below, and this page will be replaced by a full README when the program is complete.

<h5> 2 August, 2016 </h2>
- Added initial code from Arduino IDE.
- Added circuit diagram

<h5> 6 August, 2016 </h2>
- Created a GUI in Matlab with start/stop button to use as counter.
- Adapted the voltage-measuring function from Arduino IDE to Matlab.
- Will merge this code later.
