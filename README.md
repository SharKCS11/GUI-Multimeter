# GUI Multimeter
This is a small multimeter that can be used to measure voltage and current in a circuit. The electronics are built using an Arduino Mega2560 (Arduino UNO will suffice as well), which can interface with both Ruby and Matlab code.

The project build updates are detailed in Changelog.md ; check back on this page for instructions on how to build and run the combined voltmeter/ammeter on command line, Matlab GUI, or Ruby GUI.
