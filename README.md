# GUI Multimeter
This is a small project to construct a combined voltmeter and ammeter that will output results to a GUI. The GUI will be first built in Matlab and possibly C++. Diagrams may show any board, but all circuits and code files are being built around a Funduino Mega-2650.

Updates will be posted below, and this page will be replaced by a full README when the program is complete.
